If you're still interested in code, please contact me.

# PiBot
The [@PiBot](https://telegram.me/PiBot) is a Telegram bot based on [tg-cli](https://github.com/vysheng/tg). That means he does not require a username which ends with bot, he could possibly add/remove users in groups, but therefore he can't show a custom keyboard to the users and is a little bit slower than those API-bots. The PiBot runs bash-plugins through an organising Lua script.

<b>ATTENTION:</b> The PiBot is not constantly running. It's just an early beta.

He can also not reply in Secret Chats, SuperGroups, Channels.


Getting started
---------------
simply write him a message, he will answer you. Write `help` to see his command list.

* In private chat you can send commands as plain text, but in groups you need to add the operator (usually `!`) before the command
